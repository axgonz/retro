## Intent
 
To help FastTrack for Azure (FTA) improve our understanding of real-world deployments with the goal to improve and maintain quality advice and guidance. 

## Scope
 
This retro will be run from your perspective.
 
We will help you to focus on how you were successful and how you could change your approach for future projects.  
 
We will help you to NOT focus on the FTA engagement. We are still happy to collect this feedback at the end, but it is not the primary objective of this session. Please refer to the intent for this retro (above). 
 
We will start by asking you to revisit your project's goals (as they were defined when you started your engagement with FTA). These will be used during the retro to help draw focus and to determine if your solution has achieve these goals.

## Let's start

- Q: What were your project objectives?

- Q: How did you deviate from FTA advice and what was the impact (for better / for worse)?

- Q: How would you have delivered your project differently?

- Q: Did you achieve the goals you planned with us at the start of the engagement?

- Q: What was the gap between end of the engagement and BAU runtime.
